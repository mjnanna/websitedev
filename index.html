       		<h3>About</h3>

        </header>

        <p>Dr. Nanna received his Ph.D. in Educational Research and Statistics from Wayne State University. The substantive focus of his research was examining the comparative robustness and power properties of both parametric and non-parametric statistics under real-world data conditions (e.g. data that violates prescriptive underlying assumptions such as normality and homogeneity of variance). He spent eight years working at the Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan and worked on numerous grants addressing issues related to Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI), Spinal Cord Injuries (SCI), and Gerontology - specifically neuropsychological issues among the elderly such as depression and dementia.</p>

		<p>While completing a post-doc at Arizona State University, Dr. Nanna’s research focused on policies surrounding standardized testing and for-profit higher education and their differential impacts among economic and culturally disadvantaged students. His interests were eventually drawn to criminology and law enforcement – particularly the relationship of cultural, socio-economic, and psychological factors underlying participation in criminal activity. Dr. Nanna attended the Oakland Police Academy and subsequently worked as a Police Officer from 2007 until 2016. He currently serves as the Associate Director of Data Management in the Graduate School at Wayne State University.</p>
